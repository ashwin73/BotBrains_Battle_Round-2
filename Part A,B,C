A) The required parameters for computing the maximum angle of inclination are:
Dimensions of the wheel diameter and distance between the two sides of the base. Increased wheel size and broader base enhance stability and enable more tolerance for higher tilt angles.
The stability of the robot is influenced by the position of its center of mass in relation to its wheels. A lower center of mass enhances stability when tilting at greater angles.
The motor's torque and power are crucial factors in the robot's capacity to correct tilts and sustain equilibrium.
Precision and speed of sensor detection: Gyroscopes and accelerometers must possess high accuracy and responsiveness in order to immediately identify tilts.
Algorithm: The effectiveness of the control algorithm in handling sensor data and modifying motor outputs to counterbalance tilts is vital.
The maximum allowed tilt angle might be influenced by surface conditions and external disturbances related to terrain and environmental factors.

B) The major but basic concept behind two-wheeled self-balancing robots (TWSBR) is its capacity to maintain dynamic balance through the use of sensors and algorithms. 
Accelerometers and gyroscopes (mainly MPU6050) are used by these robots to continuously monitor their tilt angles and motions. 
This real-time sensor data is processed by complicated algorithms, such as PID controllers or more advanced methods to determine and adjust the wheels' speed and direction. 
By dynamically adjusting motor outputs depending on detected deviations from upright posture (intially straight), TWSBRs achieve stability and mobility in a range of scenarios, 
enabling applications such as personal transportation, delivery services, and surveillance that are both efficient and flexible.

C)Ultimately, we can create a limb-like structure that possesses the capability to securely hold and let go of objects. This structure will be situated at the extremity of the limb. 
  Integrate and rectify the robotic arm onto the TWSBR frame, ensuring that it does not compromise the robot's balance or movement. Employ lightweight materials to reduce the extra weight
  and maintain stability. Develop or adjust control algorithms to coordinate the movements of the robotic arm with the TWSBR's balancing system. 
Secondly, include sensors, such as cameras or depth sensors, to allow the robot to detect and accurately ascertain the position of objects that are appropriate for manipulation. 
  Computer vision algorithms can be employed to precisely identify and classify objects, together with techniques for grasping and manipulating them.
Advantages: The TWSBR possesses the capability to do tasks that extend beyond just locomotion. The device is capable of grasping and relocating items, operating doors,
            and assisting in the process of assembling goods. Enhances the robot's autonomous decision-making by integrating object manipulation capabilities, hence reducing the need
            for human intervention in certain tasks.Broadens the range of applications for TWSBRs in industries such as logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and home support.
